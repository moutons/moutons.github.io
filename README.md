=================

This GitHub Pages Blog thing is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with some configuration stuff pulled from [JJ Asghar](https://github.com/jjasghar/jjasghar.github.io/), Rake tasks from [Adolfo Villafiorita](https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-rakefile), and other stuff from other people I can't remember at the moment. Since Jekyll is MIT licensed, that's the license I applied to the repository, but posts are licensed CC-by-sa 4.0, as indicated in the site footer.
