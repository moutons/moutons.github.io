## First Do No Harm

I should start by saying that pretty much everything I have to say in this post applies to pretty much every workplace I've been in, technology or no. I don't intend for this to be a dig at Chef in particular, Chef customers, or any of the Chef community. Any criticism I level is meant to trigger introspection, with the intent to enlighten and improve.

## Context

In the past year, the Support team had two members move on to greener pastures, one member join another team at Chef, and the team supervisor moved on as well. The experience of being one of the more senior members of the team, and gaining ever more context in the company, has reinforced some of the learning I wrote about last year, but shown me some new things as well.

I found myself relying more on long-past experience managing other folks, and working with other managers to improve cross-team collaboration, than on direct technical skills. That being said, I'd guess that I submitted more PRs and technical feedback over the past year than during my first two years at Chef. Having the context to know where and how to contribute is quite meaningful, and I hope to be able to guide new folks through their own journeys as well.

## Customer-Facing Teams

It's interesting that some of the most innovative work being done at the company right now seems to be coming from customer-facing teams. Some of that might be due to the restrictions of having some folks in the engineering org directly tasked with Project Management and Product Management, although I expect to see some major benefits from that over the next year.

## Walk Like a Duck

One catchphrase that gets a lot of mileage these days is "Assume positive intent."

Another goes something like "People tell you who they are when they interact with you. If you don't believe them, it's on you."

Remember to be on the lookout for ducks. If it waddles, quacks, and appears ducklike, take some time to consider whether it is, in fact, a duck.

## Silos

It's amazing to me how many perspectives there are on what this devops thing is. I tend to think of it as a practice that emcompasses the learnings embedded in The Phoenix Project, The DevOps Handbook, and The Unicorn Project. I consider those fundamental reading for anyone who wants to "do devops", and it's amazing to me how many people haven't done so yet call what they're doing "devops". The fact that things called DevSecOps, DataOps, FinOps, etc. exist make me think folks didn't read The Phoenix Project, because it's very explicit in the book that Security, Finance, etc. are all included in the practice.

It's impressive how sneaky organizational silos are. Folks mean well when they create a thing inside an organization in secret, only inviting a few folks, then get blindsided at how the thing they've created to improve the organization doesn't function outside the original silo. Conway wept.

## Wrap It Up, B

I think that's it. Happy New Year, all!
