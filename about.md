Hi! I'm Shaun Mouton. I tried for years to become something other than a Linux system administrator, but my plans were for naught. I've given some talks about bringing systems thinking, lean startup, agile software engineering and devops philosophies to the City of Austin. I've talked some more about mental health services, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness practice, and destigmatizing mental health issues. I talk a lot, so I've talked about some more stuff - configuration management (I was one of the founders of the Austin Puppet User Group), considerations and successful patterns when migrating applications from datacenters to AWS, and more.

You can find me on Twitter as [@sdmouton](https://twitter.com/sdmouton), on github as [moutons](https://github.com/moutons), on [#_hangops_ slack](http://signup.hangops.com/) as sdmouton, and follow a similar pattern elsewhere on the internet to great success.
