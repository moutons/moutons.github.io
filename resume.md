## SUMMARY
As I grow in my engineering career, I find that my passions and strengths lie in a few overlapping areas: communication, process improvement, and building learning organizations. I help teams improve communication and cross-domain collaboration by identifying shared pain points and solving them together. I focus on improving developer feedback loops, streamlining artifact promotion processes, and evangelizing stable and secure engineering patterns to improve operational reliability. I bring extensive experience in improving knowledge transfer, so context and knowledge is shared between teams.

### Languages
