## Longer Bio

Shaun tried for years to become something other than a sysadmin, but despite working as a painter, a caseworker in a community mental health agency, and every job he could in restaurants those attempts came to naught. He works as a systems engineer and architect leveraging DevOps concepts, having come to it by reading the work of W. Edwards Deming in the mid-2000s. He is a co-chair of the DevOpsDays Austin conference and active in the Austin tech community. He speaks about migrating and updating legacy workloads and processes to their cloud-native counterparts, process improvement, building knowledge organizations, making work visible, and human-centered workplace design. In the past he has talked about destigmatizing mental health issues, mindfulness practices, and disability rights.
