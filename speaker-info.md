## Short Bio

Shaun isnâ€™t a devops but can help sprinkle some on your infrastructure, apps, and/or culture. Friendgineering 4 lyfe, hugops not harm, tirefi.re benevolent underlord.

## Longer Bio

Shaun tried for years to become something other than a sysadmin, but his plans were for naught. He's given some talks about bringing systems thinking, lean startup, agile software engineering and devops philosophy stuff, mostly in the Austin area. In the more distant past, he's talked some more about mental health services, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness practice, and destigmatizing mental health issues. He talks a lot about configuration management, considerations and successful patterns when migrating applications from datacenters to AWS, and more.

You can find him on Twitter as [@sdmouton](https://twitter.com/sdmouton), on github as [moutons](https://github.com/moutons), on [#_hangops_ slack](http://signup.hangops.com/) as sdmouton, and follow a similar pattern elsewhere on the internet to great success.
